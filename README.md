# wvr.sh

My personal site https://wvr.sh

------

Made with a custom built static site template system in POSIX sh.

Meant to be a simpler to use system than [rawk](https://github.com/kisom/rawk) or [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org/wiki).

Plan to release it publically at some point, for now its in early stages / testing.
