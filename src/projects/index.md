An extremely simple POSIX sh static site generator.

It is what powers [this](https://github.com/mitchweaver/wvr.sh) site!

### 2019

## 1\. [bonsai](https://github.com/mitchweaver/bonsai) *(discontinued)*

![bonsai_logo](https://github.com/bonsai-linux/bonsai/raw/master/res/bonsai.png)

[Bonsai](https://github.com/mitchweaver/bonsai) is a tiny Linux distribution based on [musl-libc](http://musl-libc.org) and static linking.

It was an experiment in extreme minimalism with focus on 
reducing [moving parts](https://github.com/bonsai-linux/bonsai#core-philosophy) and automating the task of chroot sandboxing.

However, my views toward static linking have changed dramatically since this project.

## 1\. [Discline](https://github.com/mitchweaver/discline) *(discontinued)*

![discline_logo](https://github.com/mitchweaver/Discline/raw/master/res/logo/logo_small.png)

Python discord [TUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchweaver/Discline/master/res/screenshots/screenshot_main.png) client, no longer maintained.

I also [no longer](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html) recommend the use of [discord](https://stallman.org/discord.html).

## 2\. [metal-archives](https://github.com/mitchweaver/metal-archives)

![ma_releases_demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchweaver/metal-archives/master/res/releases.png)

Various web scraping utilities for the [Encyclopaedia Metallum](http://metal-archives.com).

Started out as functions for an IRC bot but since they are so handy I gave them their own project.

### 2016

## 1\. [SJGS](https://github.com/mitchweaver/sjgs) *(discontinued)*

![sjgs physics demo](/res/projects/sjgs_phys_demo.jpg)

There was a stint in my old years where I wanted to be a game dev.

A few copies of the games made with this still [remain](https://old.reddit.com/r/Nihilne/) on the [dark](https://u.teknik.io/2l5vU.png) corners of the internet...
