## 1\. bonsai *(discontinued)*

![bonsai_logo](https://github.com/bonsai-linux/bonsai/raw/master/res/bonsai.png)

`bonsai` was a tiny Linux distribution based on [musl-libc](http://musl-libc.org) and static linking.

It was an experiment in extreme minimalism with focus on reducing [moving parts](https://github.com/bonsai-linux/bonsai#core-philosophy) and
automating the task of chroot sandboxing via not necessitating copying of libraries for binaries.

However, my views toward static linking have changed drastically since this project.

![discline_logo](https://github.com/mitchweaver/Discline/raw/master/res/logo/logo_small.png)

Python discord TUI client, no longer maintained.

I also now do [not](https://stallman.org/discord.html) recommend the use of [discord](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html).

## 2\. [metal-archives](https://github.com/mitchweaver/metal-archives)

Various web scraping utilities for the [Encyclopaedia Metallum](http://metal-archives.com).

Started out as functions for an IRC bot but since they are so handy I gave them their own project.

![sjgs physics demo](/res/projects/sjgs_phys_demo.jpg)

There was a stint in my old years where I wanted to be a game dev.

A few copies of the games made with this still [remain](https://old.reddit.com/r/Nihilne/) on the [dark](https://u.teknik.io/2l5vU.png) corners of the internet...
