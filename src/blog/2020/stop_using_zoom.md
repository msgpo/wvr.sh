# Stop Using Zoom.

Many workplaces and schools, including [my](http://dsu.zoom.us) university, are mandating the
use of a before relatively unheard of proprietary video conferencing service
named [Zoom](http://zoom.us).

Tied closely with Facebook[^1] and other analytic companies,
Zoom is a cash grab[^2] being promoted amidst the chaos of the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid-19) pandemic.

It's troubling [privacy policy](https://zoom.us/privacy) is a source of growing concerns[^3].

Some European governments have even banned its use[^4].

Zoom has also been subject to a [number](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2159/Zoom.html) of severe privacy[^5] exploits[^6].

Instead, I encourage you to use a privacy-respecting open source 
alternative such as [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org), [Wire](https://wire.com/en), [8x8](https://8x8.vc), [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/talk) or many others,
and petition your community to switch to them as well.
