# Stop Using Zoom.

Many workplaces and schools, including [my](http://dsu.zoom.us) university, are mandating the
use of a before relatively unheard of proprietary video conferencing service
named [Zoom](http://zoom.us).

Tied [closely with Facebook](https://vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account) and other analytic companies,
Zoom is a [cash grab](https://zoom.us/pricing) being promoted amidst the chaos of the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid-19) pandemic.

It's troubling [privacy policy](https://zoom.us/privacy) is a source of [growing concerns](https://nytimes.com/2020/03/30/technology/new-york-attorney-general-zoom-privacy.html)

Some European governments have even [banned its use](https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/25/concern-zoom-video-conferencing-mod-bans-security-fears-12455327).

Elon Musk recently banned its use [within SpaceX](https://reuters.com/article/us-spacex-zoom-video-commn/elon-musks-spacex-bans-zoom-over-privacy-concerns-memo-idUSKBN21J71H).

Zoom has also been subject to a [number](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2159/Zoom.html) of severe [privacy](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/07/09/zoom-flaw-could-force-mac-users-into-meetings-expose-video-feed) [exploits](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21082331/zoom-vulnerability-hacker-eavesdrop-security-google-hangouts-skype-checkpoint).

Instead, I encourage you to use a privacy-respecting open source 
alternative such as [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org), [Wire](https://wire.com/en), [8x8](https://8x8.vc), [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/talk) or many others,
and petition your community to switch to them as well.
